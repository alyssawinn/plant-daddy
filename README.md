# Plant Daddy

## Project Proposal
An application that helps indoor plant lovers learn about their plant babies. It allows users to create an account and save information about the care of their plants.

## MVP
* Homepage to search plants from database (name, description, image, by difficulty) and log in
* Once logged in, users can save searched plants to their profile (ones they want or ones they own)
* Logged in users will be able to name plants, log recent care (last time watered, etc.)
